# Knapsack Problem
Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

# FSMD
Basic Finite State Machine with Datapath (FSMD) example to get the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W.

## Install

These examples use [ModelSim&reg; and Quartus&reg; Prime from Intel FPGA](http://fpgasoftware.intel.com/?edition=lite), [GIT](https://git-scm.com/download/win), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), make sure they are installed locally on your computer before proceeding.

## Usage

1. Grab a copy of this repository to your computer's local folder (i.e. C:\projects):

    ```sh
    $ cd projects
    $ git clone https://github.com/Salem22/knapsack.git
    ```
2. Use Visual Studio Code (VSC) to edit and view the design files:

    ```sh
    $ cd knapsack
    $ code .
    ```
    Click on the catalan_toplevel.vhd file in the left pane to view its contents.
    
3. From the VSC View menu, choose Terminal, in the VCS Terminal, create a "work" library:

    ```sh
    $ vlib work
    ```
    
4. Compile all the design units:

    ```sh
    $ vcom *.vhd
    ```
    
5. Simulate your design. For example, if n = 3, w2 = 50 then y = 220:

    ```sh
    $ vsim work.tb
    ```
